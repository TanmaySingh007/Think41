# Milestone 4: Database Refactoring - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Successfully refactored the database schema to separate departments into their own table, improving data organization and enabling better department management.

## Database Schema Changes

### **Before Refactoring**
```sql
-- Single table with department as text field
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  description TEXT,
  price REAL,
  department TEXT,  -- Stored as text
  image_url TEXT,
  stock_quantity INTEGER
);
```

### **After Refactoring**
```sql
-- Separate departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Products table with foreign key relationship
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  price REAL NOT NULL,
  department_id INTEGER NOT NULL,  -- Foreign key to departments
  image_url TEXT,
  stock_quantity INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments (id)
);
```

## Key Improvements

### ✅ **Data Integrity**
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensures products can only reference valid departments
- **Unique Department Names**: Prevents duplicate department entries
- **Referential Integrity**: Maintains data consistency

### ✅ **Better Organization**
- **Normalized Schema**: Departments stored once, referenced by ID
- **Reduced Redundancy**: No duplicate department strings
- **Easier Management**: Department changes affect all related products

### ✅ **Enhanced Queries**
- **JOIN Operations**: Products and departments linked efficiently
- **Department-Specific Queries**: Easy filtering by department
- **Aggregation Support**: Count products per department

## API Endpoints Added

### **Department Endpoints**
- `GET /api/departments` - Get all departments
- `GET /api/departments/:id` - Get department by ID

### **Updated Product Endpoints**
- All existing product endpoints work with refactored schema
- Products now include `department_id` and `department` name
- JOIN queries provide complete department information

## Database Migration Process

### **1. Schema Creation**
- Created `departments` table with proper constraints
- Updated `products` table with `department_id` foreign key
- Maintained backward compatibility in API responses

### **2. Data Migration**
- Extracted unique departments from existing product data
- Inserted departments into new table
- Updated products with correct `department_id` references

### **3. Query Updates**
- Updated all product queries to use JOINs
- Maintained same API response format
- Added department-specific queries

## Test Results

### **Database Tests**
```
✅ Departments table working
✅ Products table with foreign key working
✅ JOIN queries working
✅ Data integrity maintained
```

### **API Tests**
```
✅ GET /api/departments - Get all departments
✅ GET /api/departments/:id - Get department by ID
✅ GET /api/products - Get all products (with department info)
✅ GET /api/products/:id - Get product by ID (with department info)
✅ GET /api/products/department/:department - Get products by department
✅ Database refactoring successful
✅ Foreign key relationships working
```

## Sample Data Structure

### **Departments Table**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Electronics",
    "description": null,
    "created_at": "2025-07-31T05:30:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-07-31T05:30:00.000Z"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Clothing",
    "description": null,
    "created_at": "2025-07-31T05:30:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-07-31T05:30:00.000Z"
  }
]
```

### **Products Table (with department info)**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Wireless Headphones",
  "description": "High-quality wireless headphones with noise cancellation",
  "price": 199.99,
  "department_id": 1,
  "department": "Electronics",
  "image_url": "https://images.unsplash.com/...",
  "stock_quantity": 50
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### **1. Data Quality**
- **Consistency**: Department names standardized
- **Integrity**: Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned records
- **Validation**: Database-level validation of relationships

### **2. Performance**
- **Efficient Queries**: JOIN operations optimized
- **Indexing**: Department IDs can be indexed
- **Reduced Storage**: No duplicate department strings

### **3. Maintainability**
- **Easy Updates**: Change department name in one place
- **Scalability**: Easy to add department attributes
- **Flexibility**: Support for department metadata

### **4. API Enhancement**
- **New Endpoints**: Department management capabilities
- **Better Responses**: Complete department information
- **Future-Ready**: Foundation for advanced features

## Next Steps
Ready for **Milestone 5: Departments API** - Adding more advanced department management features and **Milestone 6: Department Filtering** - Implementing frontend filtering capabilities.
