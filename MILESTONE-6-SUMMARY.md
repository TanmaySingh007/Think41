## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
```
App.tsx
├── ProductPageLayout.tsx
│   ├── MobileFilterToggle.tsx
│   ├── SearchAndFilter.tsx
│   │   └── DepartmentFilter.tsx
│   └── ProductList.tsx
└── ProductDetail.tsx
```

### State Management Flow
1. **Filter Changes**: User interactions trigger filter state updates
2. **Hook Processing**: useFilteredProducts processes filter changes
3. **API Calls**: Backend requests with filter parameters
4. **Data Updates**: Component re-renders with new filtered data
5. **UI Updates**: Visual feedback and result summaries update

### Performance Optimizations
- **Debounced Search**: Prevents excessive API calls during typing
- **Memoized Components**: React.memo for performance-critical components
- **Lazy Loading**: Efficient data fetching with loading states
- **Responsive Images**: Optimized image loading for different screen sizes

## API Integration

### Backend Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/products` - Fetch all products
- `GET /api/products/search` - Search products with filters
- `GET /api/departments` - Fetch departments with product counts
- `GET /api/products/department/:name` - Filter by specific department

### Filter Parameters
```typescript
interface SearchParams {
  query?: string;
  department?: string;
  sortBy?: 'name' | 'price' | 'department';
  sortOrder?: 'asc' | 'desc';
}
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Functional Testing
